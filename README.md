# SoilFertilityML
* This project investigates the predictive power of machine learning models in assessing soil fertility and its correlation with vegetation cover in . By using techniques like Random Forest(RF), Decision Trees (DT), Linear Regression, and simple ensemble methods, we develop models to predict soil fertility levels based on a range of soil properties.
* We found that soil properties vary depending on how we use the land. This matters because it can help us take care of the land better and deal with issues like pollution. Our research contributes to soil science and helps with farming, nature protection, and land management.
