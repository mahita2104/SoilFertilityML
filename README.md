# SoilFertilityML
This project investigates the predictive power of machine learning models in assessing soil fertility and its correlation with vegetation cover in . By using techniques like Random Forest(RF), Decision Trees (DT), Linear Regression, and simple ensemble methods, we develop models to predict soil fertility levels based on a range of soil properties.
